# Boolean Function Monotonicity Checker

This repository contains a Python script to check the monotonicity of a given Boolean function.
The program reads the predefined conditions from the table, ensuring the 18 rows correspond to the regulation conditions that satisfy the monotonic requirement, considering the presence or absence of activators/inhibitors.

#### Program Logic:
- Read the table data.
- Implement the logic to check monotonic regulation conditions.
- Output the conditions that satisfy the monotonic requirement.


## Files

- `monotonicity_check.py`: The Python script to check monotonicity.
- `output.txt`: The output of the script.

## Usage

Run the script with the command:

```bash
python monotonicity_check.py
